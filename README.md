# oj! Algorithms

oj! Algorithms - ojAlgo - is Open Source Java code that has to do with mathematics, linear algebra and optimisation. The motivation behind most of the development has been various financial applications, but what's here is (mostly) just maths.

General information about ojAlgo can be found at: http://ojalgo.org/

Downloads of prebuilt versions are found at SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ojalgo/files/ojAlgo/

For bug reports, questions or discussions related to ojAlgo; please use the ojAlgo-user mailing list: http://sourceforge.net/p/ojalgo/mailman/ojalgo-user/

This repository is a copy of the DevProj module of the CVS repository at SourceForge. These two code locations are used in parallel, and are manually (semi-automatic) kept in sync. This solution is (probably) temporary. Most likely there will only be one code repository in the future.

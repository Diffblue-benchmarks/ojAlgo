ojAlgo is available at [The Central (Maven) Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.ojalgo%22%20AND%20a%3A%22ojalgo%22) to be used with your favourite dependency management tool.

This repository is a copy of the DevProj module of the CVS repository at SourceForge. These two code locations are used in parallel, and are manually (semi-automatic) kept in sync. This solution is (probably) temporary. Most likely there will only be one code repository in the future.

## Isues and Discussions

For bug reports, questions or discussions related to ojAlgo; please use the ojAlgo-user mailing list: http://sourceforge.net/p/ojalgo/mailman/ojalgo-user/
(Please note that you have to be a member to post to that list!)

If you prefer you may also use "Issues" here at GitHub, but then please make sure your post actually relates to an issue with the source code (bug reports or suggested improvements). The issue tracker is not for user support or general discussions.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute any way you want. One very good way to contribute is to supply test cases that verify that the functionality you use works as expected. The ojAlgo code base is often refactored. Test cases specific to your use case can be very beneficial (for you) in assuring future releases.

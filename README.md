This repository is a copy of the DevProj module of the CVS repository at SourceForge. These two code locations are used in parallel, and are manually (semi-automatic) kept in sync. This solution is (probably) temporary. Most likely there will only be one code repository in the future.

The reason this repository exists is to encourage cooperation and contributions. GitHub enables that social part of open source development very well.
